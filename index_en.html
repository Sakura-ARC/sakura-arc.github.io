        <h2 class="section-heading">About the Agency</h2>
        <p>Kamiya Detective Agency is a small private office nestled quietly in a corner of Fukuoka City.<br>
          Headed by former police detective Kamiya, and joined by his assistant Hikaru, they face daily mysteries with determination.<br>
          Although they don't accept requests officially, it's not just pretend detective work—probably.<br>
          Oh, and I (Hikaru) also serve as the publicity manager! I'm in charge of this website and our updates on X (formerly Twitter)!</p>
      </section>

      <section id="about" class="centered-section left-text">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Investigation File</h2>
        <p>The client is Ms. Mariko Nagumo.<br>
          Her daughter, Saki (17 years old / 2nd year student at Wakafuji High School), has suddenly gone missing.<br>
          In her room was a strangely cheerful note: "I'm running away (＾▽＾) Don't look for me ♡".<br>
          Her phone is unreachable, and time is passing with no word from her.<br><br>

          The police have been informed, but they treat it as a voluntary runaway and haven't actively investigated.<br>
          However, Ms. Nagumo feels something is off—like the note might not have been written by Saki herself…<br><br>

          That’s why Detective Kamiya and I (Hikaru, his assistant) have taken on the case!<br>
          We’re collecting witness accounts around Fukuoka to unravel the mystery behind Saki’s vanished summer.<br><br>
